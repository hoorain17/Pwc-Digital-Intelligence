# PwC Switzerland Digital Intelligence Job Simulation

Welcome to the **PwC Switzerland Digital Intelligence Virtual Experience**! This job simulation is designed to give you an insight into the work done by PwC's Digital Intelligence team. Through hands-on tasks, you will develop skills in data analysis, machine learning, financial modeling, and business strategy.

## Project Overview

A large bank has requested an evaluation of its marketing algorithms used for retail banking. The bank’s phone marketing algorithm predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit and optimizes the phone calling strategy accordingly. While the algorithm has been successful, management now wants to understand the decision-making process behind the classification model.

As a consultant in this simulation, you will analyze and explain how classification models influence business decisions and how responsible AI principles can be applied to enhance transparency and fairness.

## **Task 1: Understanding AI and Responsible AI**
### **Background**
Responsible AI is a growing concern for business leaders, as AI-driven decision-making needs to be explainable and justifiable. PwC’s Responsible AI approach aims to make AI models transparent, fair, and accountable for different stakeholders.

### **Task Objective**
- Research the concept of Responsible AI and its significance.
- Understand and document how AI models make decisions.
- Outline the risks associated with black-box AI models and how they impact business.
- Provide a structured explanation of how transparency in AI benefits organizations.

---

## **Task 2: Data Analysis & Feature Engineering**
### **Background**
To evaluate the marketing algorithm, we need to analyze historical data, extract important features, and understand key factors that influence model predictions.

### **Task Objective**
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to identify patterns and inconsistencies in the dataset.
- Analyze key features that influence the classification model.
- Engineer new features that might improve model performance.
- Document the process and findings.

---

## **Task 3: Building & Evaluating the Classification Model**
### **Background**
Now that we have cleaned and processed the data, it’s time to build a **classification model** that predicts whether a customer will subscribe to a term deposit.

### **Task Objective**
- Train a **Random Forest classifier** and evaluate its performance.
- Explain key evaluation metrics such as **precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC**.
- Analyze the impact of different features on model predictions.
- Compare different classification models and justify the selection of the final model.

## **Task 4: Model Explainability & Responsible AI Implementation**
### **Background**
Management needs insights into **how** and **why** the model makes specific predictions. Ensuring explainability is crucial for building trust in AI-driven decisions.

### **Task Objective**
- Utilize tools such as **SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations)** or **LIME (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)** to explain model decisions.
- Identify potential biases in the model and suggest ways to mitigate them.
- Ensure the model aligns with Responsible AI principles such as fairness, accountability, and transparency.
- Present findings in a structured and understandable manner for non-technical stakeholders.

---

## **Task 5: Business Strategy & Final Report**
### **Background**
The final step is to communicate insights to senior management. The report should translate **technical findings into business impact** and provide actionable recommendations.

### **Task Objective**
- Summarize key insights from the data analysis, model evaluation, and explainability.
- Provide recommendations on improving the marketing strategy based on AI insights.
- Suggest **Responsible AI best practices** to enhance transparency and fairness.
- Prepare a final presentation or executive summary for stakeholders.

---

## **Key Takeaways**
- **Understanding AI Decision-Making**: How classification models drive business strategies.
- **Data Science & Machine Learning**: Exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Responsible AI Principles**: Ensuring fairness, accountability, and transparency in AI-driven decisions.
- **Business Communication**: Translating technical findings into business insights.
